--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Chakra Developement Team is proud to announce the availability of Phoix

In this a brand new DVD-Edition release with our own base!
Over 2000 packages (4076 in all repos) are now available for our new Distribution and 
almost 850 get installed by this media.

We all try to give you the best experience Chakra GNU/Linux can give you atm.

You got Kaffeine, K3B, Koffice, Networkmanager-Plasmoid and other great apps you need 
to get started with our brand new Distribution.

On this image we installed all translations we offer.
Even in live-mode you have your translated menues.

It took us some weeks to pull this off, so give us some feedback ;)

Test this build and report back in our forum.
Please don't use this image for productive use.
